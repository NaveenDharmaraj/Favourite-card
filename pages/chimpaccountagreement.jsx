The User or the Person so designated shall cease to be the Designated Advisor on his or her death, or on retiring and so advising the Foundation, and the User (where applicable and where the User is not the Designated Advisor) in writing.</p>
                    <p>7.2 The User, or the retiring Designated Advisor, as the case may be, may designate a replacement, by giving notice in writing to the Foundation and the User, where applicable.</p>
                    <p>7.3 A Designated Advisor who is not the User shall have the same rights and duties with respect to the CHIMP Account as if the Designated Advisor were the User. In particular, a Designated Advisor shall be entitled to receive information and have access and may make recommendations and give instructions to the Foundation, unless the User revokes the designation and advises the Foundation otherwise in writing. For greater certainty, a User may designate another Person to be a Designated Advisor and continue to be a Designated Advisor. In case of uncertainty, the Foundation may rely on and act on recommendations and/or instructions from the User rather than those of other Designated Advisors.</p>
                    <p>7.4 If a User dies and there is no Designated Advisor for the Account, the executors or other personal representatives of the User may act as the Designated Advisor. If at any time the Foundation reasonably believes there is no Designated Advisor for an Account and is unable, after reasonable efforts, to contact the User or the Designated Advisor who was last designated according to the Foundation's records, paragraph 16.1 will apply.</p>

                    <p>8.1 Funds or other assets may be Disbursed from a CHIMP Account only to Qualified Recipients but can be Transferred to other CHIMP Accounts, Giving Group Accounts or Community Accounts. Funds or other assets can be Transferred from your CHIMP Account to your Charitable Investment Account, but no recommendations for Disbursements may be made from a Charitable Investment Account. Funds or other assets may be Transferred from your Charitable Investment Account to your CHIMP Account, from which Disbursements may be made.</p>
                    <p>8.2 A Designated Advisor may submit to us recommendations regarding Disbursements from your CHIMP Account to Qualified Recipients and may submit to us instructions regarding Transfers from your CHIMP Account to Giving Group Accounts or to other CHIMP Accounts or from your Charitable Investment Account to your CHIMP Account. However, while we will strictly follow instructions regarding Transfers, we retain ultimate discretion and authority to make or not make Disbursements and we are not bound by any recommendations. If there is no CHIMP Account or Giving Group Account to which the Transfer can be made, and if no such Account is opened within thirty (30) days of our receipt of the instructions for Transfer, we will put the funds or other assets back into the account of the Transferor.</p>
                    <p>8.3 Giving Group Administrators may submit to us recommendations regarding Disbursements from the Giving Group Account to Qualified Recipients and may submit to us instructions regarding Transfers to CHIMP Accounts or to other Giving Group Accounts or Community Accounts. However, we retain ultimate discretion regarding Disbursements and we are not bound by any recommendations. If there is no CHIMP Account or Giving Group Account to which the Transfer can be made, and if no such Account is opened within thirty (30) days of our receipt of the instructions for Transfer, will put the funds or other assets back into the account of the Transferor. Notwithstanding the definition of "Giving Group Administrator", a Giving Group Member may designate another Giving Group Member to be a Giving Group Administrator and at any time there may be more than one Giving Group Administrator with whom the CHIMP Collective is authorized to deal with in respect to information relating to a particular campaign or a particular movement in which the Giving Group is participating.</p>
                    <p>8.4 We fully consider the recommendations made by Users. However, in order to comply with applicable legal requirements, the Foundation retains the final discretion and authority with regard to Disbursements. Disbursements from your CHIMP Account or from a Giving Group Account shall be made at such times, in such amounts, in such ways and for such purposes as we may determine in our sole and unfettered discretion.</p>
                    <p>8.5 After any Disbursement or Transfer is made from your CHIMP Account or from a Giving Group Account, an electronic record of such Disbursement or Transfer will be made available to you on the CHIMP System. Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, when a Transfer is made from one or more Accounts on the CHIMP System, the CHIMP Collective will have no obligation to ensure that the holder of the Account to which the Transfer has been made will recommend that the Foundation Disburse funds to a particular Qualified Recipient. When funds or other assets in a Giving Group Account are applied to a campaign or to a movement, the Giving Group Administrator or other designated person dealing with the Giving Group Account will have total discretion and the CHIMP Collective will have no obligation to the Giving Group Members or to a particular campaign or movement with respect to such application.</p>
                    <p>8.6 A User or Designated Advisor may give a Default Instruction or a Default Recommendation to the Foundation. If a valid Default Recommendation is in effect at the relevant time, the Foundation will take it into account in deciding when and how to make a Disbursement to a Qualified Recipient. If a valid Default Instruction is in effect at the relevant time, the Foundation will act in accordance with that Instruction, subject to the other provisions of this Section 8 and in particular paragraphs 8.2, 8.3 and 8.5.</p>
                    <p>8.7 Neither you nor any other Person may receive any tangible benefit or privilege in return for a Disbursement or Transfer from any CHIMP Account or any Giving Group Account. No Disbursement or Transfer from any CHIMP Account or any Giving Group Account may be used to discharge or satisfy a legally enforceable obligation of any Person.</p>         
                    <p>8.8 Upon the termination of your CHIMP Account, we will Disburse any funds or other assets remaining in your CHIMP Account in our sole and unfettered discretion to one or more Qualified Recipients, which may include us, subject to any valid Default Recommendation.</p>
                    <p>8.9 Upon termination of a Giving Group Account, we will Disburse any funds or other assets remaining in the Giving Group Account in our sole and unfettered discretion to one or more Qualified Recipients, which may include us, subject to any valid Default Recommendation.</p>

                    <Header as="h1">9. Minimum CHIMP Account Activity</Header>
                    <p>9.1 The CHIMP Collective has a mandate to facilitate Donations for the good of the charitable sector and not simply for the issuance of Donation tax receipts. Consequently, while we plan to encourage Donations to the Foundation, we simultaneously will encourage Users to Disburse funds or other assets to Qualified Recipients so they can be used for charitable programming and activities that advance causes and communities. </p>
                    <p>In order to encourage Disbursements, if in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months the total Disbursements from your CHIMP Account are less than five percent (5%) of the Donations and Transfers received in your CHIMP Account in the same period or the average value of the net assets held in your CHIMP Account at the end of each month during the previous twelve (12) consecutive months, whichever is greater, we may contact you to request (a "Disbursement Request") that you recommend a Disbursement (a "Minimum Disbursement") to one or more Qualified Recipients. A Minimum Disbursement means five percent (5%) of the greater of:</p>
                    <div className="minimum-chimp">
                        <List as='ul'>
                            <List.Item as='li'>the total of the Donations and Transfers received in your CHIMP Account in the previous twelve (12) consecutive months less all Disbursements and Transfers made in that period; and</List.Item>
                            <List.Item as='li'>the average of the value of the net assets held in your CHIMP Account at the end of each month during the previous twelve (12) consecutive months, less all Disbursements and Transfers made in that period.</List.Item>
                        </List>
                    </div>
                    <p>9.2 In addition to CHIMP Collective's mandate described in paragraph 9.1, the Foundation has adopted policies to comply with applicable tax law and the disbursement quota requirements for public foundations in the Income Tax Act.</p>
                    <p>9.3 Transfers made to other CHIMP Accounts during the relevant twelve (12)-month period will be reflected in the Disbursement calculations of the destination Account. However, if it appears to the Foundation that Transfers are being made with the intention of avoiding Minimum Disbursement requirements, we retain the right to make Disbursement Requests at our discretion.</p>
                    <p>9.4 If you do not respond to our Disbursement Request within sixty (60) days, the Foundation may Disburse, in the Foundation's sole and unfettered discretion, the Minimum Disbursement from your CHIMP Account to one or more Qualified Recipients, including the Foundation for its own use, subject to any valid Default Recommendation that is in effect.</p>
                    <p>9.5 Notwithstanding paragraph 9.1 of this Agreement, a CHIMP Account must maintain a minimum activity level of at least one Disbursement for each period of twelve (12) consecutive months, starting with the second such period that ends after the creation of the Account, based on receipt of a recommendation contemplated in paragraph 8.2 of this Agreement. Failure to maintain a minimum activity level may result in termination of the CHIMP Account.</p>
                    <p>9.6 The rights of the Foundation as set out in this section 9 including, without limitation, the right to make a Disbursement Request and the right to make a Minimum Disbursement are at the sole and unfettered discretion of the Foundation. Exercise by the Foundation of any of its rights under this section 9 shall not be construed to be a waiver of any other right contained in this Agreement.</p>
                    <p>9.7 Since the objective is to encourage Disbursements, the same rules with respect to Minimum Disbursements and Disbursement Requests within a period of twelve (12) consecutive months apply to a Giving Group Account to the same extent as if it were a CHIMP Account and the provisions in paragraphs 9.1 through 9.6 were applicable, with required changes in the context.</p>

                    <p>10.1 We recognize that giving together as a group enables donors to better identify a specific cause they wish to support and to organize with a larger number of like-minded donors. We want to create and promote these opportunities through Giving Groups, campaigns, movements and other, more expanded means of collective giving.</p>
                    <p>10.2 Users may create Giving Groups using the CHIMP System and invite other Users, One-Time Donors and other Persons to become Giving Group Members. The creator of the Giving Group is by default the Giving Group Administrator and may designate another member of the Giving Group as an Administrator. Each Giving Group may have one or more Administrators.</p>
                    <p>10.3 Giving Groups may Transfer and Disburse funds at the sole individual discretion of each Giving Group Administrator.</p>
                    <p>10.4 A Giving Group may participate in a particular movement, a particular campaign, or a particular expanded means of organizing Giving Groups, campaigns and movements, using the CHIMP System.</p>
                    <p>10.5 A Giving Group will have only one Giving Group Account, although records will be maintained by the CHIMP Collective for campaigns, movements and other, more expanded means of organizing Giving Groups.</p>
                    <p>10.6 Where a Giving Group participates in a campaign or movement, a Giving Group Member designated by the Giving Group may deal with the CHIMP Collective to receive information and have access relating to the campaign or movement from the CHIMP System.
